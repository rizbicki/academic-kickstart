# Biography


I'm a statistician born in São Paulo, Brazil, and graduated from the University of São Paulo in 2008. From 2010 to 2014, I was a PhD student at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/), USA. Currently, I'm at the Department of Statistics of the Federal University of São Carlos.

I’m interested in theory, methodology, applications, and foundations of statististics and machine learning.
